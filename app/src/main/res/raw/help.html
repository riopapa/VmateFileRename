    <h3>Function : Convert vmate files into valid date time format </b></h3>
    o Current Snoppa vmate app creates media file including colon(:) and timezone is not local.<br>
    o Some video play app in android phone can NOT understand this colon, and spit out that video <br>
    o This app will rename or copy vmate media files into Camera Folder (DCIM/vmate) with proper name.<br>
    <h3>How to operate</h3>
    o When this app is loaded, it will display all the file list you downloaded from vmate gimbal.<br><br>
    o On Setting screen,
    <h5>You may set time zone to fit your local time</h5>
    <h5>You may select rename or copy option</h5>
    <h5>If copy with delete option is selected, each files in source folder is copied into destination folder, it will be deleted, like moving..</h5>
    <h5>You know that original files are still in vmate gimbal sdcard.</h5>
    <h5>If ready, click <b><i>play icon</i></b>, then copying will be started while displaying current progress.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from : \Vmate\sd/DCIM/100HSCAM<br>
