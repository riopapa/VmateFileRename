# Vmate File Copy
**VmateFileCopy** is file copy application only for snoppa vmate

## Function : Convert snoppa vmate gimbal files into valid date time format

- Current Snoppa vmate creates file name with colon(:) and timezone is not local.
- Some video play app in android phone can NOT understand this colon, and spit out that video 
- This app will copy vmate media files into Camera Folder with more proper name.
- You need to set your timezone before starting copy (by clicking clock icon)

## How to operate

- When this app is loaded, it will display all the file list you downloaded from vmate app.
- On setting screen
#### set your time zone
#### choose whether source file will be deleted or not
If selected, it will delete source file just after copying to destination. It will be helpful if your external storage is not so big.
#### file location information
- source : _\Vmate\sd/DCIM/100HSCAM_
- destination : _DCIM\vmate_

## Notice

- No guarantee for improving functions
- This app copies vmate file into camera folder not renaming itself
- This app will be disparated when snoppa vmate gives proper file name.

## Remarks
